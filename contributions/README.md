# Contributions

To ensure consistency and transparency in ODPS development we have defined a process to follow in order to contribute.&#x20;

We have different processes for breaking and non-breaking changes simply because we need to assure backwards compatability in versions. Read more about versioning from separate page under Specification: [versioning-practices.md](../specification/versions/versioning-practices.md "mention")&#x20;

If you don't know is the change breaking change or nor, don't worry. Follow the standard process and maintainers will make the jugdment and act accordingly. But of course optimal solution is known or suspected breaking change cases is to use given process. That speeds up the processing and possible merge.&#x20;
