# Contributions

To ensure consistency and transparency in ODPS development we have defined a process to follow in order to contribute.&#x20;

We have different processes for breaking and non-breaking changes simply because we need to assure backwards compatability in versions. Read more about versioning from separate page under Specification: [versioning-practices.md](../specification/versions/versioning-practices.md "mention")&#x20;
