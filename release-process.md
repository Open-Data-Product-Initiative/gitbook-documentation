# Release process

Maintainers decide on the release schedule implementation after approvals from both Technical Steering Committee and Strategy Group.&#x20;

For each planned release Technical Steering Committee will make s proposal for the release schedule and content which is then reviewed by the Strategy Group. This is done to ensure again review between two sides: technical and business.&#x20;

The Technical Steering Committee is responsible for release quality, while the Strategy Group is responsible for the long-term roadmap and making sure the release fits in the plan.&#x20;

Strategy Group is the final approving body since it defines and supervises the product roadmap.&#x20;



## Minor release process steps

Each release is derived from the Development version.&#x20;

1. At the decided moment Release Candidate is forked from the Development version. The Release Candidate is named clearly with RC in the name and in the repository path/url.&#x20;
2. RC is available for comment for 30 days from publishing. During that time everyone can raise issues with it and necessary fixes are done. Optimally any changes are not needed and this is just a review to make sure everything is in shape.&#x20;
3. After 30 days from the publishing of the RC version, it will be approved and a new minor release will be published.&#x20;



## Major release process steps

A major release is commonly a release that contains breaking changes and results in to increase in the highest-level versioning. If for example, current major release number is now 2.1. and a new major release is to be done, the next version is 3.0. Major release has to be handled a bit differently since it has a bigger effect on the consumer ecosystem.&#x20;
