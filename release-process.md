# Release process

Maintainers decide the release schedule implementation after approvals from both Technical Steering Committee or Strategy Group.&#x20;

For each planned release Technical Steering Committee will make s proposal for release schedule and content which is then reviewed by the Strategy Group. This is done to assure again review between two sides: technical and business.&#x20;

Technical Steering Committee is responsible for release quality, while Strategy Group is responsible for long term roadmap and to make sure release fits in the plan.&#x20;

Strategy Group is the final approval since they define and supervise the product roadmap.&#x20;



## Minor release process steps

Each release is derived from Development version. At the decided moment Release Candidate is forked from the Development version. The Release Candidate is named clearly with RC in the name and in repository path/url.&#x20;

RC is available for commenting for 30 days from publishing. During that time everyone can raise still issues with it and necessary fixes are done. Optimally any changes are not needed and this is just review to make sure everything is in shape.&#x20;

After 30 days from the publishing of RC version, it will be approved and new minor release is published.&#x20;



## Major release process steps

Major release is commonly a release which contains breaking changes and results to increase in highest level versioning. If for example current major release number is now 2.1. and new major release is to be done, the next version is 3.0. Major release has to be handled a bit differently since it has bigger effect on consumer ecosystem.&#x20;
