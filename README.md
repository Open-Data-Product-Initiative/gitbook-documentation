# Introduction

Adopting a governance model and drawing up a project governance document as early as possible are critical for the creation of a successful open development project. Nothing should prevent the project initiators from documenting their model at project inception.

However, there is no need for the first version of the projectâ€™s governance model to be fully detailed; a framework setting out the starting position is sufficient. Nor does the governance document need to account for every possible future scenario. The idea is to start with a simple and manageable model that will send clear signals to potential contributors. A successful open development project needs to be welcoming to those who are likely to contribute in a way that improves project sustainability, while preventing those with incompatible needs from wasting their own time and that of the project team in fruitless engagements with the project.

In order to be effective, a governance document needs to be concise, accessible and easy to refer to. It should focus on the main aspects of the decision making structure and mechanism, but needs to be flexible enough to address the increasing complexity associated with the growth of its community and interaction with the external world.

The above summarizes the need for this document.&#x20;
