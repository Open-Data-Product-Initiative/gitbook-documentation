# New improvement

Typical process to follow:

* New idea is suggested in Github issues. System adds automatically label "enhancement"
* It is reviewed in TSC staff and idea is clarified in issue comments.&#x20;
* The issue is added label "exploration"&#x20;
* I person is named to do background study of the subject at hand. The person documents the findings. Intention is to find needed information for the next step.
* Decision based on discussions and above mentioned exploration documentation if we should proceed
* A person is named to the design of the improvement.&#x20;
* Design is done with implementation. It is encouraged that you present the design to the community to get feedback before implementation. Sometimes this is not needed because improvement is so simple
* The results are contributed as pull request. Use own development branch, do not commit to master branch.&#x20;
* Pull request is reviewed at least by one other contributor
* Contribution might be modified based on review results.&#x20;
* Contribution is either merged and closed or declined simply by closing it. In the latter case clear reason must be documented in the comments. &#x20;
